Since the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, the world has witnessed rapid advancements in aerospace technology. From the historic Apollo moon landings to the establishment of the International Space Station, humanity has continued to push the boundaries of what is possible. In recent years, space missions have moved beyond governmental agencies. Private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab are pioneering reusable rocket technology, drastically reducing the cost of launching satellites and paving the way for commercial space travel. These ventures have also inspired ambitious goals such as colonizing Mars and mining asteroids for rare minerals. Simultaneously, robotic missions to planets and moons have uncovered new data, such as evidence of subsurface oceans on Europa and organic molecules on Mars. With the James Webb Space Telescope now delivering breathtaking images of galaxies billions of light-years away, our understanding of the cosmos continues to deepen.
